## What does it do?

MineSharp is a simple and quite bad looking Minecraft Launcher, written in C#.\
But there's a twist: everything happens in the console!

Everything works exacty like you would expect a GUI to work, but it's just... in the _Console_!

4. You can now close the window.

6. Extract the file to your desired location.

7. Run the `MineSharp.exe`.

> If you don't want to play cracked, select `Sign In` to log in with your microsoft account.

The rest is pretty similar to any other launcher... Just way worse!

### Installer

1. Download `MineSharp.Install.msi` from the [releases tab](https://github.com/immortal640/MineSharp/releases) (expand "Assets").

2. Run the Installer.

3. If you see "Windows protected you PC", you can safely ignore it by clicking `More info`, then `Run anyway`.<br>

   > Why does this show up?<br>
   > To get certified developers usually need to purchase a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), which can cost between 100€ and 500€ anually. This is just not feasable for a hobby project.

4. You will be presented with the MineSharp Setup Wizard. Follow the setup wizard's instructions to continue. Now you should have successfully installed MineSharp!
