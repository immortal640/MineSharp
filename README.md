# MineSharp

## What does it do?

MineSharp is a simple and quite bad looking Minecraft Launcher, written in C#.\
But there's a twist: everything happens in the console!

Everything works exacty like you would expect a GUI to work, but it's just... in the _Console_!

The rest is probably similar to any other launcher... Just way worse!
